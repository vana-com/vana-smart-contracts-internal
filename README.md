## Deploy your own DLP, DLP Root, and Token smart contracts on Satori

1. Install hardhat: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started#installation
2. Clone the DLP Smart Contract Repo: https://github.com/vana-com/vana-dlp-smart-contracts/
3. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

4. Run tests to be sure everything is ok
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

5. Create an `.env` file for the smart contract repo. You will need the owner address and private key. Customize the DLP name, token name, and token symbol as needed.

```
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=8...7
OWNER_ADDRESS=0x3....1
SATORI_RPC_URL=https://rpc.satori.vana.org

DLP_NAME=Custom Data Liquidity Pool
DLP_TOKEN_NAME=Custom Data Autonomy Token
DLP_TOKEN_SYMBOL=CUSTOMDAT
```
6. Deploy the DataLiquidityPoolsRoot smart contract

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network satori --tags DLPRootDeploy
```

This will deploy the `DataLiquidityPoolsRoot` smart contract using the recommended params for testing. If you need a different setup, you can change them in the deploy/root.ts script.

7. Verify the `DataLiquidityPoolsRoot` contract:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network satori <data_liquidity_pools_root_address>
```

8. Deploy the `DataLiquidityPool` and `DataLiquidityPoolToken` smart contracts

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network satori --tags DLPDeploy
```

This will deploy the `DataLiquidityPool` and `DataLiquidityPoolToken` smart contracts using the recommended params for testing. If you need a different setup, you can change them in the `deploy/dlp-deploy0.ts` script.

9. Verify the `DataLiquidityPool` and `DataLiquidityPoolToken` contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network satori <data_liquidity_pool_address>
npx hardhat verify --network satori <data_liquidity_pool_token_address> "<token_name>" <token_symbol> <owner_address>
```

If you get an error, it may be because the block explorer has already verified matching bytecode. Check your contract in the block explorer. If it is verified, you can ignore the error.

10. Congratulations, you've deployed the DLP & token smart contracts. You can confirm it's up by searching the address on the block explorer: https://satori.vanascan.io/address/<contract_address>.

11. Now you should configure the deployed DLP contract:
    1. Visit the Satori block explorer: https://satori.vanascan.io/address/<contract_address>
    2. Go to the "Write proxy" tab
    3. Connect your wallet (make sure it's the owner wallet used for deployment)
    4. Set the following parameters:
        - Call `updateFileRewardDelay` and set it to 0
        - Call `addRewardsForContributors` with a large value (e.g., 1000000000000000000000000 for 1 million tokens)
    5. For each function call, confirm the transaction in your wallet

   These steps ensure that rewards can be claimed immediately and that there are sufficient tokens allocated for rewards.

12. If you need to upgrade the `DataLiquidityPool` contract in the future, you can use the `dlpOld-upgrade.ts` script:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network satori --tags DLPUpgrade
```

This will upgrade the `DataLiquidityPool` contract to the latest version while preserving its state and address.

By following these steps, you can deploy the complete set of smart contracts (`DataLiquidityPoolsRoot`, `DataLiquidityPool`, and `DataLiquidityPoolToken`) to the Satori network and verify them on the block explorer. The `DataLiquidityPoolsRoot` contract manages the creation and reward distribution for multiple DLPs, while each `DataLiquidityPool` contract handles validator registration, file uploads, and reward distribution within its specific pool.


Based on the provided Solidity contract, here is a README file in Markdown format for the `DLPT` contract:

# DLPT Contract

The `DLPT` (DLP Token) contract is an ERC20 token with additional features such as minting permissions, an admin role, and a blocklist for addresses. It leverages OpenZeppelin's ERC20, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes, and Ownable modules for extended functionality.

## Features

- **Minting Control:** Minting can be blocked permanently.
- **Admin Management:** Change and assign an admin who has special permissions.
- **Blocklist Management:** Add and remove addresses from a blocklist.
- **Voting and Permit:** Supports ERC20Votes and ERC20Permit extensions for governance and permit functionality.

## Events

- `MintBlocked()`
- `AdminChanged(address indexed oldAdmin, address indexed newAdmin)`
- `AddressBlocked(address indexed blockedAddress)`
- `AddressUnblocked(address indexed unblockedAddress)`

## Errors

- `EnforceMintBlocked()`
- `UnauthorizedAdminAction(address account)`
- `UnauthorizedUserAction(address account)`


## Functions

### Constructor

#### DLPT
```solidity
constructor(address ownerAddress) ERC20("DLP Token", "DLPT") ERC20Permit("DLP Token") Ownable(ownerAddress)
```
you can modify the contract name and the constructor's arguments for deploying Token with your own name and symbol.


### mint
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external virtual onlyOwner whenMintIsAllowed
```
Mints a specified amount of tokens to the given address.

### blockMint
```solidity
function blockMint() external virtual onlyOwner whenMintIsAllowed
```
Blocks any future minting of tokens permanently.

### changeAdmin
```solidity
function changeAdmin(address newAdmin) external virtual onlyOwner
```
Changes the admin address.

### blockAddress
```solidity
function blockAddress(address addressToBeBlocked) external virtual onlyAdmin
```
Adds an address to the blocklist.

### unblockAddress
```solidity
function unblockAddress(address addressToBeUnblocked) external virtual onlyAdmin
```
Removes an address from the blocklist.

### blockListLength
```solidity
function blockListLength() external view returns(uint256)
```
Returns the number of addresses in the blocklist.

### blockListAt
```solidity
function blockListAt(uint256 _index) external view returns(address)
```
Returns the address at the specified index in the blocklist.

# Data Liquidity Pool Smart Contract

The Data Liquidity Pool smart contract is designed to manage the registration of validators, file uploading by data contributors, and reward distribution within a decentralized network. This contract ensures that validators can participate in maintaining the network's integrity and security while earning rewards for their contributions.

The Data Liquidity Pool contract facilitates several key functions:

- **Validator Registration**: Allows users to register as validators and participate in the network.
- **Reward Distribution**: Validators earn rewards based on their performance and contribution, distributed periodically.
- **File uploads**: Data contributors can upload files and earn rewards based on the quality of their data

## Functions

### registerValidator
```solidity
function registerValidator(address validatorAddress,address validatorOwnerAddress, uint256 stakeAmount) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant
```

Registers a new validator in the system. The caller must have enough Tokens to stake as part of the process. Once registered, the validator must be approved by the DLP owner in order to be eligible for validating files and for epoch rewards.

#### Functionality

1. Checks if the validator is not already registered.
2. Ensures the stake amount is above the minimum required.
3. Transfers the stake amount from the sender to the contract.
4. Updates the validator's information and status.
5. Increases the total count of validators and updates the total staked amount.
